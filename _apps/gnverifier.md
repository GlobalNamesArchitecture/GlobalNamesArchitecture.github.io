  <p>GNverifier helps to find a correct match of submitted name strings to names
  in all or some data sources. GNverifier uses fuzzy matching algorithm, parsing
  and partial matching to give as close matching result as possible for all
  lexical variants of a name. GNverifier uses two other Global Names projects
  as a backend: <a href="https://github.com/gnames/gnames">GNames</a> provides
  an API for GNverifier, <a htref:="https://github.com/gnames/gnmatcher">GNmatcher</a>
  provides algorithms for fast exact and fuzzy matching of names.</p>
