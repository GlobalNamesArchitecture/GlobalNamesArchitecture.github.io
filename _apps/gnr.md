  <p>Resolver helps to find a correct match of submitted name strings to names
  in all or some data sources. Resolver uses fuzzy matchin algorithm, parsing
  and partial matching to give as close matching result as possible for all
  lexical variants of a name. In the future Global Names Resolver and Global
  Names Index will merge into one application.</p>
