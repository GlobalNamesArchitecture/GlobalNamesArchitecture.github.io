Moving Global Names to a stable ground... On October 1st I did sign a job offer
from [Species File Group][sfg] and going to start at the new position on
November 16th. This position is supported by a fund created by [David
Eades][davideades] (thank you David) and allows to think of grants not like a
vehicle for GN's survival, but means of further enhancement of the system. I am
honored and touched that David, and [Species File Group][sfg] created this
amazing opportunity for Global Names. This move should also lead to a tight
integration between [Catalogue of Life][col] and Global Names, which in my view
is a win/win situation for both projects and for biodiversity.

Our next steps are releasing JVM-based [scientific name parser][gnparser],
building scalable, reliable and fast name resolution service and integratation
of  name resolution with the key Global Names project developed by [Rich
Pyle][richpyle] and [Rob Whitton][robwhitton] -- [Global Names Usage
Bank][gnub] for which Rich just submitted a grant proposal.
