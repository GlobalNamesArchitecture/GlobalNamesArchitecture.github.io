Last year we did get the second round of funding for Global Names Architecture
development. Our [first grant][gn1] had been about exploration of how to find
scientific names in texts, how to crossmap different spelling variants of the
same names to each other, how to connect names to literature collected at
[Biodiversity Heritage Library][bhl], how to organize scientific name usages,
how to register new zoological scientific names electronically. Several
intersting projects spanned out of this effort and you can read about them
at [Global Names site][globalnames].

It was a hard year for [Encyclopedia of Life][eol] where I work, and for Global
Names. I did have to spend most of the first 8 months since our second NSF
grant got funding helping EOL with system administration support and transfer
EOL site from Harvard to Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. It is done now,
and I am happy to be able to work on Global Names project again!
