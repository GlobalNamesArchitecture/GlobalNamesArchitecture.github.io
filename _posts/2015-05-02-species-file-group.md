Trying to find a permanent home for GN I travelled to Champaign-Urbana on
Thursday-Friday to visit [Species File Group][sfg] at the University of
Illinois. I do know this group rather well, as [Lisa Walley][lisa] and I went
there more than a year ago for a hackathon organized by [Matt Yoder][matt].

I am quite impressed with work this group is doing and when Matt suggested
me to join them -- my first thought was -- this might be a way to make
Global Names financial situation more reliable!

Currently Global Names completely depends on grants, and grants come and go. It
is a pretty bad way to finance an infrastructure project, as you do not want to
have roads or electricity depend on unstable funding. We always want to be able
to drive to a store or a concert, and we want to always be able to have lights
in our homes.  Same goes with projects like GN. If people start using them --
they start depend on them and it is really bad situation when funding dries out
and service deteriorates as a result.

The visit went well. I had a great opportunity to talk to David Eades, Matt,
Dmitry Dmitriev, and Yuri Roscov. It was especially great to talk to Yuri, as
he is the main person behind the [Catalogue of Life][col] content. I consider
Catalogue of Life to be one of the most important use cases and partners for
GN, and talking to Yuri for an extended amount of time was extremely
helpful.

Originally position was about helping Yuri to automate his work-flow, however
when Matt and I talked on Skype the accent started to shift towards supporting
Global Names. David Eades, Matt, and Yuri all believe that GN is a missing link
in Catalogue of Life functionality and as such by working closely with Yuri,
and figuring out what GN can do for Catalogue of Life actually does help to
automate some of hard parts of Yuri&rsquo;swork.

The meeting was very encouraging and inspiring. Now I have to think hard and
make a decision.  I would love be able to keep my house on Cape and I would
love to be able to come in summer and work with MBL and [RISD][risd].
