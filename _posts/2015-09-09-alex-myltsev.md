Global Names is happy to welcome a new member -- Alexander Myltsev
(@alexander-myltsev on GitHub). Alexander is of [parboiled2] fame. Parboiled2
is a [Parsing Expressed Grammar][peg] parser for Scala, and it did originate
from Alex' code which he wrote as a Google Summer of Code participant in 2013.

Alexander lives in Moscow and currently works on a port of biodiversity parser
to Scala; the project is called [gnparser]. The new parser is compatible with
Java, JRuby, Jython and everything else written for Java virtual machine
environment. When the parser is ready it will be the basis of a new Scala-based
collection of GN tools.

Alexander had been working with us for a few months now, but I had been waiting
with the announcement until major paperwork hurdles were solved.
