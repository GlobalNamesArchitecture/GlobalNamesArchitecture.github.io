If you use [Global Names Resolver][resolver] and you are interested in
vernacular names associated with scientific names you can add
[with_vernaculars=true][with_vernaculars] flag to see them.  If you are most
interested in particular [data sources][data_sources] you can add
[data_source_ids] setting.
