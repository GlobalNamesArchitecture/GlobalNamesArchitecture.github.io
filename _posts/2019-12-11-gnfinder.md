We are releasing a bug-fixing version (v0.9.1) of
[gnfinder](https://github.com/gnames/gnfinder), a written in Go project that
provides ability to search for scientific names in plain UTF-8 encoded texts.
It now has a better version and build timestamp report, its black list
dictionary expanded by 5 more words, and a bug fixed that prevents client
programs to break if name-verification returned an error instead of result.
We also started experimenting with making gnfinder available for other
languages through a C-shared library.

More can be found in gnfinder's
[CHANGELOG file](https://github.com/gnames/gnfinder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

The gnfinder code is used to create scientific name indices
in Biodiversity Heritage Library, HathiTrust Digital Library, and serves as an
engine for [GNRD](https://gnrd.globalnames.org)
