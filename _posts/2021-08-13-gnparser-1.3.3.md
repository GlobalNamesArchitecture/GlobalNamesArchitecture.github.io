[GNparser v1.3.3] is out. The following changes happened since 1.3.0:

* GNparser received a [citable DOI] (v1.3.1)

* [Names-exceptions] that are hard to parse because they use some nomenclautral,
  or biochemical terms as specific epithets are [now covered]. Some examples:

```txt
Navicula bacterium
Xestia cfuscum
Bolivina prion
Bembidion satellites
Acrostichum nudum
Gnathopleustes den
```

* 2-letter generic names are appended with [3 more genera] (`Do`, `Oo`, `Du`).

```txt
Do holotrichius (beetle)
Oo spinosum (arachnid)
Nu aakhu (annelid)
```

* Known prefixes in authorships are appended with [3 more prefixes] adding
support for authors like:

```txt
delle Chiaje
dos Santos
ten Broeke
ten Hove
```

* Parsing of names with [ms in] like `Crisia eburneodenticulata Smitt ms in Busk, 1875` is 
supported (normalized to `Crisia eburneodenticulata Smitt ex Busk, 1875`).

* More [annotation 'stop' words are added][ms in], fixing parsing for names like:

```txt
Crisina excavata (d'Orbigny, 1853) non (d'Orbigny, 1853)
Eulima excellens Verkr√ºzen fide Paetel, 1887
Porina reussi Meneghini in De Amicis, 1885 vide Neviani (1900)
```

Many thanks to @diatomsRcool, @KatjaSchulz and @joelnitta for feature requests
and bug reports!

## Clib libraries are now provided with each new release

```txt
macos-latest-clib.zip
ubuntu-latest-clib.zip
windows-latest-clib.zip

## Update of C-binding for Ruby-based parser

The new v5.3.3 [`biodiversity` Ruby gem][biodiversity] is released using C-binding to
GNparser v1.3.3

## GNparser for JavaScript

@tobymarsden incorporated GNparser C-binding into a [Node.js package]. He plans to release the new package for NPM.
