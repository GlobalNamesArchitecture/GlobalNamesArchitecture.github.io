Today is the official start of Google Summer of Code work. Up to now
organizations submitted their ideas, organizations had been chosen by Goggle,
students decided which ideas and organizations they like and submitted their
proposals, Google decided on how many projects from every organizations they
are willing to fund, and finally -- the best proposals from students were
matched to the funded ideas. Encyclopedia of Life and Global Names submitted 4
proposals and we got 3 of them funded, so congratulations to us and to students
:)

I had been very happy to see how many people were interested in the idea of
finding scientific names in texts -- we had 12 proposals, so competition was
fierce this year! I think we got great students and I am looking forward
to the Google Summer of Code 2015.
