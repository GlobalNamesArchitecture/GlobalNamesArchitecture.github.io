For the last 8 years I had been blessed being paid by doing open source
development. It means that for that long about everything I do is almost
instantly available publicly. This model fits my way of thinking, my values,
and I see an advantage in making all I do available for public to see, comment,
and enhance.

Now I am writing a paper, and I feel being thrown into "dark ages". Whole paper
writing and publishing culture was one of the reasons I left molecular biology
and went to programming. I assume the following is usually true when people
write a scientific paper --

* People normally do not share publicly what they work on until it is published.
* People normally use proprietary software to write papers
* People often loose their copyright or ability to share their work when their paper is accepted by a journal

Obviously there is a progress with the last point, but what about other 2?

* Can I use public revision control system when I am writing a paper?
* Can I publish using a revision control system from the very first paragraph for all to see?
* What open standards/tools can I use (LaTeX, or even markdown?) for writing a paper
* Can I consider publishing paper to be a 'release', like for a program?
* Should electronic version be frozen? Can it evolve after publication?
