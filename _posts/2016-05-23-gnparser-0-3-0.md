To avoid confusion -- gnparser is a new project, different from the formerly
released biodiversity parser.

We are happy to announce the second public release of Scala-based
[Global Names Parser][gnparser] or `gnparser`. There are many significant
changes in the [v. 0.3.0 release][0-3-0-release].

* Speed improvements. Parser is about 50% faster than already quite fast 0.2.0
  version. We were able to parse 30 million names per CPU per hour with this
  release.

* Compatibility with Scala 2.10.6: it was important for us to make the parser
  backward compatible with this older version of Scala, because we wanted
  to support Spark project.

* Compatibility with Spark v. 1.6.1. Now the parser can be used in BigData
  projects running on Spark and massively parallelize parsing process using
  Spark platform. We added [documenation][spark-readme] describing how to use
  the parser with either Scala or Python natively on Spark.

* Simplified parsing output in addition to "Standard output": It analyzes the
  name-strings and returns its id, canonical form, canonical form with
  infraspecific ranks, authorship and a year.

* Improved and stabilized JSON fields. You can find complete description of
  the parser JSON output in its [JSON schema][json-schema]. We based names of
  fields on [TDWG's Taxon Concept Schema][tcs], and we indend to keep
  JSON format stable from now on.

* There were many structural changes, bug-fixes and quality improvements.
  They are described in the [release][0-3-0-release] documenation.
