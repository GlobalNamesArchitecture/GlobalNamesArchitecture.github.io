[GNparser v1.3.0] is out. The major new functionality is an ability
to recognize and parse botanical cultivar names. This ability was added to
[GNparser] by [Toby Marsden], thanks Toby for a great patch!

In addition to [ICN] nomenclatural code for botanical scientific names there is
an [ICNCP] nomenclatural code for cultivated plants. [ICNCP] supports names
like:

```text
Dahlia ‘Doris Day’
`Fragaria 'Cambridge Favourite'
`Rosa multiflora cv. 'Crimson Rambler'
```

Now, if these names are parsed as cultivars, the cultivar epithet is included
into canonical form like `Rosa multiflora ‘Crimson Rambler’`. However such
addition would create problems for users who are more interested in the
canonical form according to [ICN]: `Rosa multiflora`. Therefore, by default
[GNparser] will process such names according to [ICN] code, providing a
warning:

```json
{
  "quality": 2,
  "warning": "Cultivar epithet"
}
```

If a user does need to treat such names as cultivars, there is a flag in the
command line app: `gnparser "Rosa multiflora cv. 'Crimson Rambler'" -C`. When
parsed with this flag, warning will disappear and canonical forms will include
cultivar information. [GNparser web-interface] has a "cultivar checkbox" now,
as well as there is a "cultivar" option in [GNparser RESTful API].

Parsed detailed data for cultivars:

```bash
gnparser "Rosa multiflora cv. 'Crimson Rambler'" -C -d -f pretty
```

```json
{
  "parsed": true,
  "quality": 1,
  "verbatim": "Rosa multiflora cv. 'Crimson Rambler'",
  "normalized": "Rosa multiflora ‘Crimson Rambler’",
  "canonical": {
    "stemmed": "Rosa multiflor ‘Crimson Rambler’",
    "simple": "Rosa multiflora ‘Crimson Rambler’",
    "full": "Rosa multiflora ‘Crimson Rambler’"
  },
  "cardinality": 3,
  "details": {
    "species": {
      "genus": "Rosa",
      "species": "multiflora",
      "cultivar": "‘Crimson Rambler’"
    }
  },
  "words": [
    {
      "verbatim": "Rosa",
      "normalized": "Rosa",
      "wordType": "GENUS",
      "start": 0,
      "end": 4
    },
    {
      "verbatim": "multiflora",
      "normalized": "multiflora",
      "wordType": "SPECIES",
      "start": 5,
      "end": 15
    },
    {
      "verbatim": "Crimson Rambler",
      "normalized": "‘Crimson Rambler’",
      "wordType": "CULTIVAR",
      "start": 21,
      "end": 36
    }
  ],
  "id": "38ff69c4-7e1a-5a26-bfc4-ee641fed6ba7",
  "parserVersion": "nightly"
}
```

In addition Toby found and helped to fix problems with [stemming of hybrid
formulas][stem bug] and with providing correct [output for hybrid signs][x bug]
in the "details:words" section. Again, thanks for this contribution [Toby
Marsden]!
