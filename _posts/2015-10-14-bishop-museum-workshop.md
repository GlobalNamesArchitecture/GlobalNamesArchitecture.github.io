Last week (October 5-9 2015) @deepreef, @dimus, @alexander-myltsev had a
workshop in Honolulu at [Bishop Museum] to sync ideas, learn more about each
other work, and design new generation of services. The meeting had been
productive and I think in the end our two GN groups get integrated. We
are moving all our code under one roof at GitHub now.

We had an interesting meeting with @jar398 from [Open Tree of Life] trying to
figure out how can we connect OTOL with all the other resources on the web, and
@deepreef suggested to use his [BioGuid] project for these purposes. We moved
BioGuid to github and added all the GitHubbish bells and whistles like a
[blog][bioguid-blog] and [gitter][bioguid-gitter] for example to the project.
I think it is pretty cool that we will have a [downloadable csv][csv-ticket]
file from all the IDs @deepreef collected that can be used by all other
projects in new exiting ways.

Another interesting conversation was with [Phylotastic] project. We worked on
an idea of making an application which will allow convert pictures of
scientific names people take at museums or from pages of research papers into
texts, extract names appeared there and build phylo-trees from these names
using Open Tree. Also the app would show pictures from Encyclopedia of Life and
pages from Wikipedia. Such app will mash up interfaces of Global Names to find
and reconcile names, Open Tree to build trees, and EOL to get information
about species.
