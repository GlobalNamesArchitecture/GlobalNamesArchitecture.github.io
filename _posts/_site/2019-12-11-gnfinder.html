<p>We are releasing a bug-fixing version (v0.9.1) of
<a href="https://github.com/gnames/gnfinder">gnfinder</a>, a written in Go project that
provides ability to search for scientific names in plain UTF-8 encoded texts.
It now has a better version and build timestamp report, its black list
dictionary expanded by 5 more words, and a bug fixed that prevents client
programs to break if name-verification returned an error instead of result.
We also started experimenting with making gnfinder available for other
languages through a C-shared library.</p>

<p>More can be found in gnfinderâ€™s
<a href="https://github.com/gnames/gnfinder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG file</a>.</p>

<p>The gnfinder code is used to create scientific name indices
in Biodiversity Heritage Library, HathiTrust Digital Library, and serves as an
engine for <a href="https://gnrd.globalnames.org">GNRD</a></p>
