<p>To avoid confusion – gnparser is a new project, different from the formerly
released biodiversity parser.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce the second public release of Scala-based
<a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/gnparser">Global Names Parser</a> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gnparser</code>. There are many significant
changes in the <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/gnparser/releases/tag/release-0.3.0">v. 0.3.0 release</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Speed improvements. Parser is about 50% faster than already quite fast 0.2.0
version. We were able to parse 30 million names per CPU per hour with this
release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compatibility with Scala 2.10.6: it was important for us to make the parser
backward compatible with this older version of Scala, because we wanted
to support Spark project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compatibility with Spark v. 1.6.1. Now the parser can be used in BigData
projects running on Spark and massively parallelize parsing process using
Spark platform. We added <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/gnparser/blob/master/examples/spark/README.rst">documenation</a> describing how to use
the parser with either Scala or Python natively on Spark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simplified parsing output in addition to “Standard output”: It analyzes the
name-strings and returns its id, canonical form, canonical form with
infraspecific ranks, authorship and a year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved and stabilized JSON fields. You can find complete description of
the parser JSON output in its <a href="http://globalnames.org/schemas/gnparser.json">JSON schema</a>. We based names of
fields on <a href="http://www.tdwg.org/standards/117">TDWG’s Taxon Concept Schema</a>, and we indend to keep
JSON format stable from now on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were many structural changes, bug-fixes and quality improvements.
They are described in the <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/gnparser/releases/tag/release-0.3.0">release</a> documenation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
