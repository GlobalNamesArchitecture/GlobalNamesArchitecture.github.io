<p>I did some soul-searching, advise-gathering, thinking, planning, and crystal
ball gazing.  And it seems that moving <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1356347">Global Names grant</a> and
myself to <a href="http://software.speciesfile.org/HomePage/Software/SoftwareHomePage.aspx">Species File Group</a> is a right decision.  Why? Because <a href="http://mbl.edu">Marine
Biological Laboratory</a> is a hard core research institute, which completely
depends on grants and as such is not well-suited for <em>infrastructure</em>
projects. Global Names is definitely an infrastructure project and I know very
well how bad it is to be responsible for an infrastructure project and not
being able to work on it. It is just not a good way to do business.</p>

<p>It is my 8th year at MBL. I enjoy MBL, I love living on Cape Cod. I love an
immense energy of MBL collective mind.  I met really amazing people, amazing
scientists here. I worked with great people at <a href="http://eol.org">Encyclopedia of Life</a>
project.  And also I was never sure if I will be there next year, or sometimes
next month.  I had weeks and months when I had no ability to move forward with
Global Names, because it had no financial support at that time.</p>

<p>Species Files Group is long term financed, allowing a long term commitment.
They are interested in Global Names, they do want me to continue to develop it,
integrate it with Catalogue of Life. And these are my goals too. David Eades
understands that Global Names will need a long-term investment in hardware, and
he provides a generous annual fund for that. It means no more 7 year old
computers running Global Names services. I also hope it will help to integrate
Global Names Usage Bank, a crucial GN component developed by
<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_pyle_dives_the_twilight_zone?language=en">Rich Pyle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/whittonr">Rob Whitton</a>.</p>

<p>Another big factor is ability to work closely with programmers and taxonomists
of the SFG group. At MBL I am now the only one on EOL project (<a href="https://github.com/jrice">Jeremy</a> is
remote), and I feel I am getting stale without nomenclators/taxonomists around.</p>

<p>Of course we need to figure out how to move current GN computers without
shutting down services for a few weeks. I imagine I would have to rent an
expensive cloud setup for a month or two, and run GN from there while machines
are in transit. We will have to figure out how to transfer grant, make a new
hire for the project etc. But all of these are good problems to solve. I
believe GN suddenly got a brighter future ahead.</p>
