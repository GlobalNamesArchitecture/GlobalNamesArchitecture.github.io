<p>Moving Global Names to a stable ground… On October 1st I did sign a job offer
from <a href="http://software.speciesfile.org/HomePage/Software/SoftwareHomePage.aspx">Species File Group</a> and going to start at the new position on
November 16th. This position is supported by a fund created by <a href="http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/directory/show/dceades">David
Eades</a> (thank you David) and allows to think of grants not like a
vehicle for GN’s survival, but means of further enhancement of the system. I am
honored and touched that David, and <a href="http://software.speciesfile.org/HomePage/Software/SoftwareHomePage.aspx">Species File Group</a> created this
amazing opportunity for Global Names. This move should also lead to a tight
integration between <a href="http://catalogueoflife.com">Catalogue of Life</a> and Global Names, which in my view
is a win/win situation for both projects and for biodiversity.</p>

<p>Our next steps are releasing JVM-based <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/gnparser">scientific name parser</a>,
building scalable, reliable and fast name resolution service and integratation
of  name resolution with the key Global Names project developed by <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_pyle_dives_the_twilight_zone?language=en">Rich
Pyle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/whittonr">Rob Whitton</a> – <a href="http://globalnames.org/docs/gnub/">Global Names Usage
Bank</a> for which Rich just submitted a grant proposal.</p>
