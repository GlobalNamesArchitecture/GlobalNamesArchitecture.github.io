<p>We developed an ability to discover scientific names in millions of books in
a matter of hours. We are now able to finish name-finding for Biodiversity
Heritage Library (200 000 volumes) in 12 hours on a single laptop, and
HathiTrust Digital Library (18 million volumes, estimated 10% of all
published books) in 9 hours, using 50 servers. Scientific name-strings are
often represented differently by different sources. For example <em>Homo
sapiens</em> can be written as <em>Homo sapiens</em> Linnaeus, 1758, <em>Homo sapiens
sapiens</em>, <em>Homo sapiens</em> Linn. etc. To understand that all these variations
talk about the same species they need to be normalized. We built a tool that
normalizes 300 million name-strings per hour on a single computer. Also we
created a service that is able to verify scientific names in all existing
variations. The service validates names against well-known curated data
sources with a rate of 800,000 per hour. As a result of all these new
developments we have an opportunity to create a truly global index of
scientific names and mine biological information using scientific names as
anchors.</p>

<p>Modern biology depends heavily on scientific names. They were introduced in
18th century by Carl Linnaeus. For more than a quarter of a millennium they
are the basis of sharing information about biological taxa. Scientific names
are heavily used by researches, physicians, students, governmental agencies,
citizen scientists etc. Scientific names create a common basis for
biology and give us an ability to connect millions of medical and
biological facts together into a graph of knowledge.</p>

<p>However scientific names change quite often. According to our observations
there are about 3 different scientific names per species on average. On top
of that, scientific names usually are not rendered exactly the same way in
different publications, as we showed above, and such lexical variants of
names have to be reconciled. To collect a complete history of studies about
species we have to be able to take in account of these differences between
name variations. To provide an access to globally accumulated biodiversity
knowledge we have to scientific names in literature published in the last 250
years.</p>

<p>Our group have been participating in Global Names Architecture project since
2007 and tried to find solutions for these three major questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to find scientific names in texts?</li>
  <li>How to “normalize” lexical and spelling inconsistencies in names belonging to
the same lexical group?</li>
  <li>How to connect a given name to all names ever given to its taxon, and find
which one of these names is currently accepted as valid?</li>
</ul>

<p>Former ABI innovation grant from NSF from 2011 (#1062387) gave us an
opportunity to develop functional prototypes of programs that were answering
these questions. However, these prototypes had been too slow to be applied
to whole corpus of biological and medical human knowledge.</p>

<p>We understood that for such programs to be useful on a global scale they must
be dramatically improved in speed, quality and scalability. They must be able
to use all resources of a multi-processor computer, and scale to multiple
machines with ease. Current ABI Development funding allowed us to achieve
speed and scalability goals.</p>

<p>We developed 3 major software tools:</p>

<h2 id="parser-of-scientific-names-gnparser">Parser of Scientific Names: gnparser</h2>

<p>This tool allows to dissect vast majority of scientific names into their
semantic elements. For example it is able to find out that “Carex scirpoidea
ssp. convoluta (Kük.) Dunlop” and “Carex scirpoidea Michaux var. convoluta
Kükenthal” both have the same conservative element “Cares scirpoidea
convoluta”, but vary in rank (variety vs subspecies) “Carex scirpoidea var.
convoluta” and “Carex scirpoidea subsp. convoluta”. Such matching is very
important for aggregation of biodiversity data from a variety of sources. The
gnparser program is designed to be small, easy to install and be blazingly
fast. It is currently used by several prominent biodiversity aggregators,
such as Encyclopedia of Life and Catalogue of Life, as well as Global Names
Index. It is able to process 300,000,000 names in an hour on one computer.</p>

<h2 id="global-names-index-gnindex">Global Names Index: gnindex</h2>

<p>The gnindex service aggregates scientific names from a large number of
biodiversity data sources and uses them to verify incoming names. A user is
able to send a list of name-strings and find out if they are known names, if
they contain spelling mistakes, if they are currently accepted as valid
names, etc. Such service is important for many use cases, for example as a
verification tool for species lists collected by citizen scientists, as a
curation tool for museum collections, for mapping country species lists of
government agencies to standardized data set, such as Catalogue of Life etc.
This tool relies heavily on gnparser to align data from many sources. It is
also indispensable for verifying (reconciling/resolving) name candidates
found in texts by our algorithms. This service currently has a throughput of
800,000 names per hour.</p>

<h2 id="global-names-finder-gnfinder">Global Names Finder: gnfinder</h2>

<p>The gnfinder tool uses heuristic and natural language processing algorithms
to detect scientific names in texts. In machine learning terms it belongs to
named entity recognition class of tools. It marks parts of texts that
potentially can be scientific names, and then sends them for remote
verification to gnindex. Average book in digital libraries is about 300 pages
long. On a single machine we are able to reach a rate of name-detection to
45,000 books an hour.</p>

<p>To summarize, these new tools give us ability to create indexes of scientific
names in a matter of hours for gigantic collections of literature and make
a global index for all digitized literature possible.</p>
