<p>Big change came to GNRD, a program David Shorthouse and Dmitry Mozzherin
released back in 2012. <a href="https://gnrd.globalnames.org">GNRD</a> is a web
application that is able to find scientific names in UTF-8 encoded plain
texts, in PDFs, MS Word and MS Excel documents, and even images.</p>

<p>For a long time it used two name-finding libraries TaxonFinder (developed by
Patrick Leary) and NetiNeti (developed by Lakshmi Manohar Akella). Both
projects served us well all these years using complementary heuristic and
natural language processing algorithms. <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/">Biodiversity
Heritage Library</a>,
<a href="https://biostor.org/">BioStor</a> and many others used GNRD for detection of
scientific names for many eyars with success. However the speed for
large-scale name-finding was not satisfactory. To make large-scale
name-detection possible we developed
<a href="https://github/gnames/gnfinder">gnfinder</a> that also uses both heuristic and
NLP algorithms. With this new release of GNRD we substitute TasonFinder and
Netineti engines with gnfinder.</p>

<p>We tried hard to keep <a href="http://gnrd.globalnames.org/api">API</a> as close as
possible to how it was before, however there are a few changes, especially at
the name-verification (reconciliation and resolution) part. This change made
both name-finding and name-verification much faster with increased
quality. For example, it used to take 15 seconds to find names in a 1000-page
biological book. Now it takes only 0.5 seconds. GNRD tries to get names with
OCR errors as well, as a result you might get false positives. We do
recommend to use name-verification option to weed out such false results.</p>
