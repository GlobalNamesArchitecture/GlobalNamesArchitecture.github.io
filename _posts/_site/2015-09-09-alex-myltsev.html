<p>Global Names is happy to welcome a new member – Alexander Myltsev
(@alexander-myltsev on GitHub). Alexander is of <a href="https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled2">parboiled2</a> fame. Parboiled2
is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">Parsing Expressed Grammar</a> parser for Scala, and it did originate
from Alex’ code which he wrote as a Google Summer of Code participant in 2013.</p>

<p>Alexander lives in Moscow and currently works on a port of biodiversity parser
to Scala; the project is called <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/gnparser">gnparser</a>. The new parser is compatible with
Java, JRuby, Jython and everything else written for Java virtual machine
environment. When the parser is ready it will be the basis of a new Scala-based
collection of GN tools.</p>

<p>Alexander had been working with us for a few months now, but I had been waiting
with the announcement until major paperwork hurdles were solved.</p>
