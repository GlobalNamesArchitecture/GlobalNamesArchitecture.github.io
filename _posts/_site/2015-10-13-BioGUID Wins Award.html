<p>As we <a href="http://globalnames.org/news/2015/10/08/bioguid-moved/">annouced previously</a>, <a href="http://bioguid.globalnames.org">BioGUID.org</a> has been incorporated into the Global Names suite of indexes and services. Within two days of this happening, we recieved some wonderful news: BioGUID.org <a href="http://www.gbif.org/newsroom/news/2015-ebbe-nielsen-challenge-winners">won second place</a> in the GBIF Ebbe Nielsen Challenge! Weâ€™re very excited about this recognition, and it re-inforces our decision to incorporate BioGUID into the GNA system. You can follow continuing developments on the new <a href="http://blog.globalnames.org">BioGUID Blog</a>.</p>
