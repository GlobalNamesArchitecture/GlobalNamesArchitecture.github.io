<p>Peter Schalk and Olaf Bánki (GBIF and CoL+) came to our group today. We had a
short meeting to start connecting names from Catalogue of Life to original
nomenclatural events collected in Biodiversity Heritage Library. We had a
remote connection to folks from BHL (Joel Richard and Mike Lichtenberg), and
CoL+ (Dave Remsen, Markus Doering).</p>

<p>Markus said that he will create a list of references for proto/basionyms in
CoL+, and starting December I will start trying to connect the names from BHL
to these references. If things work well, it will enhance usability of
Col/Col+ and BHL as well.</p>

<p>Markus created today a <a href="https://gitter.im/CatalogueOfLife/colbhl">gitter
account</a> that we can use for this
project.</p>

<p>Olaf will set a weekly meetings through December-January to keep us all in
sync for this project. Will be interesting to learn from IPNI about their
approach of doing pretty much the same task.</p>

<p>We also had a good conversation with Peter, Ed Devalt and Olaf about
importance of different biodiversity projects working together instead of
trying to re-implement each other ‘wheels’. I would say there is definitely a
progress in cooperation between different initiatives and it is good news for
biodiversity informatics.</p>
