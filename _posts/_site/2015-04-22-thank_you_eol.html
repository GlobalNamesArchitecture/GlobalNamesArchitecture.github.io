<p><a href="http://eol.org">Encyclopedia of Life</a> folks made a truly glorious present to Global Names
consisting of several Dell 710 servers which were used for running EOL at
Harvard. Now, when site moved to Smithsoninan EOL donates some of these
computers to GN, and 10 of them are already at <a href="http://mbl.edu">Marine Biological
Laboratory</a>, waiting to be plugged to internet and electricity. Another
truly amazing gift from EOL is 14 100gb hard drives which will run GN
databases.</p>

<p>I feel happy warm and fuzzy – thank you EOL! I hope with this new
hardware I will be able to increase GN capacity about 5x using current code!
Next step – installing Chef, Docker, and GN applications to serve the
biodiversity community.</p>
