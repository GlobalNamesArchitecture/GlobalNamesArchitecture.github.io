<p><a href="http://bioguid.globalnames.org">BioGUID.org</a>, an indexing service that cross-links identifiers assigned to data objects in the biodiversity information universe, has now been incorporated into the Global Names suite of indexes and services. BioGUID.org represents the third major data component of Global Names (along side <a href="http://gni.globalnames.org">GNI</a> and <a href="http://gnub.globalnames.org">GNUB</a>), and replaces a less robust identifier linking service that had previously been included within GNUB.  In addition to the crucial role of cross-linking identifiers within the general GN architecture itself, the broader function of BioGUID.org falls within the scope of Global Names in the sense that identifiers can be thought of as names, and names play the same functional role as identifiers.</p>

<p>We are currently in the process of porting BioGUID into the <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture">GN GitHub</a>, and you can follow developments on the new <a href="http://blog.bioguid.org">BioGUID Blog</a>.</p>
