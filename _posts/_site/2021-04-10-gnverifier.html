<p>There are millions of checklists in use by scientists and nature enthusiast.
Very often such lists contain misspellings or outdated names. To help our users
to clean up their checklists and monitor the quality of them we are releasing
[<strong>GNverifier</strong>][gnverifier] v0.3.0 written in Go language. We support
[Semantic Versioning]. Until v1.0.0 changes in the command line options, input
and output format might not be backward compatible with previous v0.x. However
the program can be used in production. Users just need to be aware that
sometimes incompatible changes might happen.</p>

<p>We released several implementation of name-verification
(reconciliation/resolution) before. All of them did not have enough speed for
the purposes of verifying massive lists of scientific names. This release
provides from 10x to 100x throughput inmprovements compare to older versions.
For example we get 2,500 names/second on average when we work with name-strings
detected in Biodiversity Heritage Library.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>[<strong>GNverifier</strong>][gnverifier] can help to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is a name-string a real name?</li>
  <li>Is it spelled correctly, and if not, what might be the right spelling?</li>
  <li>Is the name currently in use?</li>
  <li>If it is a synonym, what data-sources consider to be currently accepted name?</li>
  <li>Is a name a homonym?</li>
  <li>What is a taxon that the name points to and where it is placed in a variety
of classifications?</li>
</ul>

<p>Name verification and reconciliation involves several steps</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exact match: input name matches canonical form located in one or more
data-sources.</li>
  <li>Fuzzy match: if no exact match is found, there is a fuzzy matching of
canonical forms</li>
  <li>Partial Exact match: if previous 2 steps failed, we remove words from the end
or from the middle of a name and try to match what is left, until we end up
with a bare genus.</li>
  <li>Partial Fuzzy match: in case if partial exact match did not work, and the
remained name is not uninomial, we apply fuzzy matching algorithms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Matched results are then sorted by [scoring aglorithm][gnparser about].</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>We observe speeds of ~2,500 names per second for checklists that are coming
from optical character recognition process and contain many misspellings.</p>

<h2 id="usages">Usages</h2>

<p>The simplest way to use gnverifier is via [web-interfce][gnverifier web].</p>

<p>By default you will get result that is</p>
