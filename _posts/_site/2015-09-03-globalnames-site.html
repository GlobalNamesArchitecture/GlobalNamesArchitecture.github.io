<p>For quite a while we used to have a Drupal-based site for GlobalNames. As we do
have now a <a href="http://github.org/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a>-based blog, it was logical to move our static site as well.
And now it did happen – both of them are accessible via <a href="http://globalnames.org">globalnames.org</a></p>

<p>This new site will continue to be an ‘official’ blog for news about GNA, we
will publish information about new releases of software here, documents and
discussions about scientific names.</p>

<p>One great thing about this move – it is possible for anybody with account at
<a href="https://github.com">github</a> to participate – if you want to add a document, or a blog item –
just fork the <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/GlobalNamesArchitecture.github.io">repository</a>, add a post to the <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/GlobalNamesArchitecture.github.io/tree/master/_posts">_posts</a> directory and
send a pull request. At some point we will add detailed instructions how to do
that.</p>
