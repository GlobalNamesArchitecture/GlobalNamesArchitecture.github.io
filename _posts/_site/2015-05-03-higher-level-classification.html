<p><a href="https://about.me/bobcorrigan">Bob Corrigan</a> sent around an email pointing at a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119248">paper in PLOS</a>
which describes new classification adopted by <a href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org/">Catalogue of Life</a>. After
looking through the paper my understanding is that it is a step forward and at
the same time business as usual for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CoL</code>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Catalogue of Life</code> needs a solid managerial classification for their data and
according to article the goal is achieved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our goal, therefore, is to provide a hierarchical classification for the CoL
and its contributors that (a) is ranked to encompass ordinal-level taxa to
facilitate a seamless import of contributing databases; (b) serves the needs
of the diverse public-domain user community, most of whom are familiar with
the Linnaean conceptual system of ordering taxon relationships; and (c) is
likely to be more or less stable for the next five years. Such a modern
comprehensive hierarchy did not previously exist at this level of
specificity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Classifications are a dirty business so as usual â€“</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These actual complexities of phylogenetic history emphasize that
classification is a practical human enterprise where compromises must be made</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Altogether looks like CoL gets a new hierarchical face.</p>
