<p>In a few weeks there will be an <a href="https://github.com/idigbio-api-hackathon/HackathonCentral/wiki">iDigBio API hackathon</a>. As I
menioned <a href="https://globalnamesarchitecture.github.io/idigbio/hakathon/2015/04/28/idigbio-api-hackathon-meet.html">earlier</a> we decided to add another API client written in
Ruby before the hackathon starts. And <a href="https://github.com/gete76">Greg Traub</a> and I are releasing
<a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/idigbio_client">iDigBio API Client</a> written in Ruby today.</p>

<p>Greg started to make a Ruby client at <a href="https://github.com/iDigBio/idigbio-ruby-client">iDigBio</a>. I took his code and
refactored it into a <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/idigbio_client">Ruby gem</a>. So now instead of 0 we have 2 Ruby
clients :smile:</p>

<p>This is the very first release, so if you will start using it and find
something is wrong/missing please submit an <a href="https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/idigbio_client/issues">issue</a>. The gem uses <a href="https://beta-search.idigbio.org/v2/">beta
API</a>, so sometimes it might get ‘stuck’. This problem will go away when
beta API will move to production.</p>
