There was a short meeting about [Catalogue of Life][col] future directions
organized at [Species File Group][sfg] at Champaign/Urbana. Concerning Global
Names it was a very productive meeting. It was great to understand the current
state of Catalogue of Life, to see that CoL is not loosing momentum inspite of
financial problems of biodiversity informatics in general. There was
definitely interest in creating more bridges between various projects.

Yuri Roskov did present a 'pilot' project of cooperation between Encyclopeia of
Life species pages group and CoL. Data about [~2000 species of
scorpions][scorpions] had been harvested from html-based site to be used in
both projects. I think it was a great exersize and I do hope it will be just
the first example of such cooperation.

From the point of Global Names there were good news too. I think it was
everybody's feeling that Global Names resolution is an important complementary
service for Catalogue of Life. Cooperation between various biodiversity
projects was brought up again and again, and organizing biodiversity
infrastructure as a mix of several projects where GBIF, EOL, CoL, GN etc
work as modules of a bigger puzzle, complement and enhance each other.

One thing that was brought up is lack of nomenclatural component in GN. I
talked about our plans to integrate [GN Usage Bank][gnub] and
[GN Resolver][gnr] and demonstrate the flow of nomenclatural data into
resolution/reconciliation process. We will try to make such connection by
November and demonstrate the workflow on upcoming GBIF/CoL workshop.
