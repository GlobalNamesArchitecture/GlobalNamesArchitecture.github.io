For quite a while we used to have a Drupal-based site for GlobalNames. As we do
have now a [Jekyll]-based blog, it was logical to move our static site as well.
And now it did happen -- both of them are accessible via [globalnames.org]

This new site will continue to be an 'official' blog for news about GNA, we
will publish information about new releases of software here, documents and
discussions about scientific names.

One great thing about this move -- it is possible for anybody with account at
[github] to participate -- if you want to add a document, or a blog item --
just fork the [repository][gn], add a post to the [_posts][post] directory and
send a pull request. At some point we will add detailed instructions how to do
that.
