As we [annouced previously], [BioGUID.org] has been incorporated into the Global Names suite of indexes and services. Within two days of this happening, we recieved some wonderful news: BioGUID.org [won second place] in the GBIF Ebbe Nielsen Challenge! We're very excited about this recognition, and it re-inforces our decision to incorporate BioGUID into the GNA system. You can follow continuing developments on the new [BioGUID Blog].
