Big change came to GNRD, a program David Shorthouse and Dmitry Mozzherin
released back in 2012. [GNRD](https://gnrd.globalnames.org) is a web
application that is able to find scientific names in UTF-8 encoded plain
texts, in PDFs, MS Word and MS Excel documents, and even images.

For a long time it used two name-finding libraries TaxonFinder (developed by
Patrick Leary) and NetiNeti (developed by Lakshmi Manohar Akella). Both
project served us well all these years using complementary heuristic and
natural language processing algorithms. [Biodiversity
Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/),
[BioStor](https://biostor.org/) and many others used GNRD for detection of
scientific names for many eyars with success. However the speed for
large-scale name-finding was not satisfactory. To make large-scale
name-detection possible we developed
[gnfinder](https://github/gnames/gnfinder) that also uses both heuristic and
NLP algorithms. With this new release of GNRD we substitute TasonFinder and
Netineti engines with gnfinder.

We tried hard to keep [API](http://gnrd.globalnames.org/api) as close as
possible to how it was before, however there are a few changes, especially at
the name-verification (reconciliation and resolution) part. This change made
both name-finding and name-verification much faster with increased
quality. For example, it used to take 15 seconds to find names in a 1000-page
biological book. Now it takes only 0.5 seconds. GNRD tries to get names with
OCR errors as well, as a result you might get false positives. We do
recommend to use name-verification option to weed out such false results.
