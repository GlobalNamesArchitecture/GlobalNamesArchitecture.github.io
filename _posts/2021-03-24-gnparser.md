Scientific name parsing allows to determine a *canonical form*, the
*authorship* of a name, and receive other meta-information. Canonical forms are
crucial for comparing names from different data sources.

We are releasing [**GNparser**][gnparser] v1.1.0 written in Go language. We
support [Semantic Versioning], therefore it is a stable version. Output format,
functions, and settings are going to be backward compatible for many years
(until v2).

This is the 3rd implementation of name-parsing for Global Names Architecture
project. First one, written in Ruby, [**biodiversity gem**][biodiversity gem],
uses now the Go code of [**GNparser**][gnparser]. Second one, written in Scala
[is archived][gnparser scala], and awaits for a new maintainer.

## Summary

[**GNparser**][gnparser] is a sophisticated software, it is able to parse the
most complex scientific names. It is also very fast, and able to parse more
than 200 million names in an hour. The parser is a core component of many other
Global Names Architecture projects.

It can be used via:

- [Web page](https://parser.globalnames.org)
- [REST API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dimus/gnparser/1.0.0)
- [Command line application](https://github.com/gnames/gnparser#command-line)
- [Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/biodiversity)
- [R package](https://github.com/ropensci/rgnparser)
- [Go Library](https://github.com/gnames/gnparser#use-as-a-library-in-go)

We also provide
[C-binding](https://github.com/gnames/gnparser/blob/master/binding/main.go) to
its code. This approach allows to incorporate [**GNparser**][gnparser] natively
into all languages that support C-binding (such as Java, Python, Ruby etc)

## Improvements since the last Scala-based release of GNparser
