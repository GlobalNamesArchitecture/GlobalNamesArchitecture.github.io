[Bob Corrigan][bob] sent around an email pointing at a [paper in PLOS][paper]
which describes new classification adopted by [Catalogue of Life][col]. After
looking through the paper my understanding is that it is a step forward and at
the same time business as usual for `CoL`.

`Catalogue of Life` needs a solid managerial classification for their data and
according to article the goal is achieved:

> Our goal, therefore, is to provide a hierarchical classification for the CoL
> and its contributors that (a) is ranked to encompass ordinal-level taxa to
> facilitate a seamless import of contributing databases; (b) serves the needs
> of the diverse public-domain user community, most of whom are familiar with
> the Linnaean conceptual system of ordering taxon relationships; and (c) is
> likely to be more or less stable for the next five years. Such a modern
> comprehensive hierarchy did not previously exist at this level of
> specificity.

Classifications are a dirty business so as usual --

> These actual complexities of phylogenetic history emphasize that
> classification is a practical human enterprise where compromises must be made

Altogether looks like CoL gets a new hierarchical face.
