For the last couple of years I have been working on making scientific-name
detection possible on a massive scale. The result of this work was creation
of several tools that increased the speed of name-finding dramatically:

* name-parsing: [gnparser](https://parser.globalnames.org)
* name-detection: [gnfinder](https://github.com/gnames/gnfinder)
* name-curation: [gntagger](https://github.com/gnames/gntagger)
* name-verification (built by Alex Myltsev): [gnindex](https://index.globalnames.org)

As a result we are able to scan large corpora of biodiversity
literature, such as Biodhiversity Heritage Library --- BHL (200 000 volumes) and
HathiTrust Digital Library (16 000 000 volumes) in a matter of hours.

Recently, we presented our achievements at Biodiversity Next conference, an
expanded version of traditional yearly TDWG meeting. I had a talk at a
symposium [Improving access to hidden scientific data in the Biodiversity
Heritage
Library](https://biss.pensoft.net/browse_user_collection_documents?collection_id=125).
You can read about it in more details at a [BHL blog
post](https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2019/11/bhl-at-biodiversity-next.html).

Such a significant collection of biodiversity literature as BHL gains
dramatically in usability from data mining efforts. For many years they use
the scientific names index that had been generated by our project: Global
Names Architecture. Several years ago generation of such index was a very
slow and laboreous task, that could not be repeated easily. With our recent
developments we are able to index BHL repeatedly with ease. It gives us
an opportunity to listen for feedback from BHL users, make incremental improvements
in our algorithms and increase the quality of scientific names index
continuously.

We are very interested to work with other people who try to enhance usability
of collections like BHL by running natural language processing and machine
learning algorithms. During the conference several researches in the field
agreed to participate in a brain-storming workshop at Illinois Natural
History Survay, Champaign/Urbana to develop new technologies for data-mining
in BHL and other similar corpora. We are planning to organize such a workshop
in April/May 2020.
