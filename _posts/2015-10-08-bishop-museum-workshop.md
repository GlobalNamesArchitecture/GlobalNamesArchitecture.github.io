This week (October 5-9 2015) @deepreef, @dimus, @alexander-myltsev are having a
workshop in Honolulu at [Bishop Museum] to sync ideas, learn more about each
other work, and design new generation of services. So far the meeting had been
productive and I think in the end 2 GN groups will be more integrated. We are
moving all our code under one roof at GitHub now.

We had an interesting meeting with @jar398 from [Open Tree of Life] trying to
figure out how can we connect OTOL with all the other resources on the web, and
@deepreef suggested to use his [BioGuid] project for these purposes. Now we are
moving BioGuid to github and adding all the GitHubbish bells and whistles like
a [blog][bioguid-blog] for example to the project.  I think it is pretty cool
that we will have a [downloadable csv][csv-ticket] file from all the IDs @deepreef
collected that can be used by all other projects in new exiting ways.
