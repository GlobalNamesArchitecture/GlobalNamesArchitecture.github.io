I am on my last leg to Boston, returning from my trip to [Species File
Group][sfg](SFG) from University of Illinois. It was a very productive trip,
and one that makes me think. Frankly, I am considering moving there. Why? Here
are reasons:

* Guys are interested in it. I am glad :)

* It gives longevity to GN. Currently GN completely depends on existence/lack
of funds. The SFG group is long term funded and I would be able to work on GN
independently of funding from NSF or other sources. Instead of thinking how to
keep GN afloat I can think about long term plans. I am able to push GN
consistently, instead of doing it from one funding to another.

* I really like the think tank. I have had talkes with Matt Yoder and Dmitry
Dmitriev before, and we had a lot of conversations now. I like their approaches,
and their knowledge, and their skills.

* Catalogue of life Connection. Yuri is there -- the person who keeps Catalogue
of Life data and GSDs in shape. I never met him before and we had a really
good time talking and figuring out how GNA can help CoL. And I think we found
many ways in which GNA can help CoL in its quest. It would make connection to
CoL much more close

* David Eads. He is just one of these amazing people you are lucky to meet in
your life
