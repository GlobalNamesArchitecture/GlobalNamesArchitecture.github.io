For over 250 years, scientific names have been used to refer to organisms. Our
literature, museums, herbaria, and databases rely heavily on names such that an
infrastructure that manages (the strings that serve as) names can discover,
index, organize and interconnect on-line information about organisms and serve
the needs of biologists. That is the vision for the Global Names Architecture
(GNA).

Rich Pyle made a very informative [introduction into problems][tdwg-talk]
Global Names is aimed to solve.

This site aims to provide information about projects released as parts of
Global Names.
